    Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.


Why can't Some men grow beards?

Dr. Jennifer Chwalek explains:
```
"It's based on genetics as well as hormones. Some men, you know, have more hair follicles, so they can grow denser, coarser beards than others. Testosterone gets converted in the hair follicle to a more potent form called dihydrotestosterone."
```
There are many problems that surround the growing of beards in this modern day:

- Some men can cultivate amazing beards, and other men can’t.  This leaves them feeling inferior and somewhat lacking.  

- Some men are time precious – and don’t have the time to sit around growing beards.

- Some men would like the freedom to play around with different styles and textures.

- Some men are gingers and the beards they yield are sub-par in comparison to their non-ginger counterparts.

- Women often miss out on the chance to own and cultivate beards

With proper techniques, hair can be preserved forever.  With the right technology it can now be exchanged between peers accross the world. 

This marketplace is designed to allow beard cultivators to sell their wares to the folically challenged so everyone can enjoy the glory of beard ownership.

    Why is it a problem that needs solving?

In a world where we have abundant choice of so many things, it’s a real problem that incidental things like genetics, ethnicity and hormone levels can have such a profound effect on the ability to grow a beard. 

 People deserve the right to choose what they do with their own bodies and finally, thank god, there’s a system in place to allow those choices to be made. Men and women deserve the freedom to buy, swap and sell their beards.
